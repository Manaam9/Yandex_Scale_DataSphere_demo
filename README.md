In 2017, for the first time, Kaggle conducted an industry-wide survey to establish a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey received 16,716 usable respondents from 171 countries and territories. If country had less than 50 responses, it was grouped to other. This survey allowed to analyse whatâ€™s happening at the cutting edge of machine learning across industries, and how new data scientists can best break into the field.
